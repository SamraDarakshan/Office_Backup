Kanapka Bot Brain Analysis
===

## API
- Initial message when joined chat (when I added to chat by default no message)
- Keyword for people to use, and trigger Bot to answer. Suggested `kanapka: `
- Answering sequence, closest definition "ordering dinner", if the waterfall approach.
- Receive Incoming call from Kanapka face recognition server (or subscribe to websocket), about approaching Pan(i) Kanapka to the office. Sending message to the chat. Suggested: `Pan(i) Kanapka will be on 7th floor in 2 min.`


## Future API
- Next Kanapka Face recognition, and sending message `Pan(i) Kanapka left the GL building`.
- Future voice request. Suggested `Hey, Kanapka!`

## How To?
- setup initial message from bot when joined/left chat?
- How to trigger Bot working from chats? (By default only 1-to-1 interaction works)
- avoid Bot of being added to contacts?
- define logic of Bot in private 1-to-1 chats? To avoid the same behavior in public chats.
